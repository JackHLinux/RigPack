# RigPack
Package list and information pertaining to my personal setup
This Repo has been created in the event that my personal drive containing my setup was lost or tempoarily removed from my possession.
This Repo allows me to run a command to pull an auto-install script to the linux box I am working from and have my packages install.
Pack one will be bare minimum tools and ease of use.
Pack two will be anything that changes appearance and function.
These will be selected at the time of installation depending on the situation.
